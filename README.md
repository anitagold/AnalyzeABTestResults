### Summary
In this project, I will analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. I need to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
